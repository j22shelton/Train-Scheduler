# Train-Scheduler
 
 This application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, including arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. In addition, users from many different machines are able to view same train times.

 Administrators can add trains with the following details:
 
 -Train Name
 -Train Destination
 -First Train Time (in military time)
 -Train Frequency (in minues)
